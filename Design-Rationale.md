 Design Rationale – Task 01
 Target Users
Women aged 18–45 looking for professional beauty and grooming services. Users typically want quick information, trust, and easy booking options.

1. Layout Structure
The website follows a single-page, conversion-focused layout:
Hero section → Services section → Contact / CTA section.
This structure reduces friction and keeps the user focused on booking.

2. UX Decisions
- Clear value proposition placed at the top
- Service cards used for easy scanning
- Minimal sections to reduce cognitive load
- Strong primary CTA for booking appointments

3. How the Design Improves Conversions
The design guides users toward booking through:
- Clear messaging
- Visual hierarchy
- Repeated CTAs
- Simple and distraction-free layout
